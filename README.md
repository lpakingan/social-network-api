# Bootcamp Challenge #18: Social Network API using NoSQL

## Summary of the Challenge
In this challenge, we were tasked with building an API for a social network web application where users would be able to share their thoughts, add friends, and react to their friend's thoughts. In order to create this application, packages such as Express.js for routing, MongoDB for storing the database, and Mongoose ODM were used.

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

## Installation 
  To run the social networking application, the following packages are required:
  - express
  - mongoose
  - dayjs

All packages can be installed by running ```npm install``` within the root directory of the application.

## Usage 
Once all packages have been installed the application can be started by using ```node index.js```. When the server has been initiated, you will be able to test out the routes of the application by using a program such as Insomnia. A demonstration of how to use Insomnia to traverse the application will be linked below.
